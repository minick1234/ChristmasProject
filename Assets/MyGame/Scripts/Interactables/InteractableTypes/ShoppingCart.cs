    //or we can use a custom class that is of type eventargs and pass whatever through there which is a bit mroe 
    //dynamic but its also more lengthy as we need to have that class created. The way i have uncommented as of now is the more industry standard way
    //and is considered the better option as it is type safe and can prevent issues down the line.
    
    //In short terms they are basically the same thing because a event handler is a delegate that takes in a Object parameter named sender, and a teventargs which is a object that extends eventargs,
    //so realistically they are the same thing and i could use the option i have commented out but for clarity sake, why remake something that already exists as it is the same shit anyway,
    //might as well use the eventhanlder one and have it just done for me and make the custom class to pass the correct params, and if im not passing params just use Eventargs.empty
    //its just more convienient even though the commented out way makes it so much faster in terms of passing info.
